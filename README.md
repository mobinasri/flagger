## Evaluating dual/diploid assemblies with HMM-Flagger

### ***Note: HMM-Flagger is an HMM-based version of Flagger, offering faster execution and higher prediction accuracy. It replaces the previous version, Flagger v0.4.0, and is recommended for all users from now on.***
### Overview

HMM-Flagger is a read-mapping-based tool that can detect different types of mis-assemblies in a dual or diploid genome assembly. HMM-Flagger recieves the read alignments to a genome assembly, uses Hidden Markov Model to detect anomalies in the read coverage along the assembly and finally partitions the assembly into four classes; erroneous, falsely duplicated, haploid (structurally correct) and collapsed.

## Quick Start In Three Steps (Needs a BAM and FASTA file)
Performing these three steps took less than 15 minutes in our internal tests for a PacBio HiFi bam file with 40x coverage. The speed of step 2 is highly dependent on the speed and bandwidth of the storage disk.

### 1. Create a whole-genome BED file

```
# Go to the working directory
# Put fasta, bam and bam index files in this directory
cd ${WORKING_DIR} 


# Create fasta index assuming that file is not gz-compressed
samtools faidx ${FASTA_FILE}


# Create a bed file covering whole genome
cat ${FASTA_FILE}.fai | \
    awk '{print $1"\t0\t"$2}' > whole_genome.bed
```


### 2. Convert BAM to COV

```
# Put the path to the whole-genome bed file in a json file
echo "{" > annotations_path.json
echo \"whole_genome\" : \"${PWD}/whole_genome.bed\" >> annotations_path.json
echo "}" >> annotations_path.json


# Convert bam to cov.gz with bam2cov program
docker run -it --rm -v${WORKING_DIR}:${WORKING_DIR} mobinasri/flagger:v1.2.0 \
  bam2cov --bam ${WORKING_DIR}/${BAM_FILE} \
                  --output ${WORKING_DIR}/coverage_file.cov.gz \
                  --annotationJson ${WORKING_DIR}/annotations_path.json \
                  --threads 16 \
                  --baselineAnnotation whole_genome
```

### 3. Run HMM-Flagger

```
mkdir -p ${WORKING_DIR}/hmm_flagger_outputs
docker run -it --rm -v${WORKING_DIR}:${WORKING_DIR} mobinasri/flagger:v1.2.0 \
        hmm_flagger \
            --input ${WORKING_DIR}/coverage_file.cov.gz \
            --outputDir ${WORKING_DIR}/hmm_flagger_outputs  \
            --alphaTsv /home/programs/config/alpha_optimum_trunc_exp_gaussian_w_4000_n_50.tsv \
            --labelNames Err,Dup,Hap,Col \
            --threads 16
```

The bed file contating HMM-Flagger predictions will be located in `hmm_flagger_outputs/final_flagger_prediction.bed`. A summary tsv file (counts will be based on windows rather than bases) will be located in `hmm_flagger_outputs/prediction_summary_final.tsv`

For example this table shows that `95.99%` of the assembly is flagged as correctly assembled:
```
cat hmm_flagger_outputs/prediction_summary_final.tsv | grep base_level | grep whole_genome | grep percentage
PREDICTION	base_level	percentage	annotation	whole_genome	ALL_SIZES	ALL_LABELS	1.24	1.37	95.99	1.40	0.00
```

### 4. (Optional) Create conservative BED

This step will create a new BED file in which some of the 'Col' or 'Dup' predictions are replaced by 'Hap' therefore it is more conservative in calling misassemblies (`final_flagger_prediction.conservative.bed`).

#### 4.1. Map diploid assembly to itself
```
# map with minimap2 and use diploid assembly as both reference and target
minimap2 -k 19 -a -x asm5 -D -I8g -t8 ${FASTA_FILE} ${FASTA_FILE} | samtools view -h -b | samtools sort -@8 > self_hom_alignment.bam

# index bam file
samtools index self_hom_alignment.bam
```
#### 4.2. Filter HMM-Flagger predictions
```
# filter flagger predictions and create a conservative BED
docker run -it --rm -v${WORKING_DIR}:${WORKING_DIR} mobinasri/flagger:v1.2.0 \
    python3 /home/programs/src/filter_hmm_flagger_calls.py \
        --inputBam self_hom_alignment.bam \
        --inputBed ${WORKING_DIR}/hmm_flagger_outputs/final_flagger_prediction.bed \
        --outputBed final_flagger_prediction.conservative.bed \
        --threads 8 ~{moreOptions}
```

### Note about coverage-biased regions
It has been observed that peri/centromeric satellite regions are prone to have coverage biases (in PacBio HiFi and ONT data). Users can add satellite repeat arrays as separate annotations to the input json for the `bam2cov` program (with enabling `--runBiasDetection`). `bam2cov` will detect if there exist coverage biases in any annotation provided in the json file and add the neccessary information to the coverage file. It will help HMM-Flagger to predict the labels more accurately. It is recommended to provide each satellite in a separate bed file for example putting HSat1A, HSat1B, Hsat2 and HSat3 in separate files.

## Running pipeline with WDL

If user has a set of unalinged reads it is easier to run the pipeline (read mapping + HMM-Flagger) using the WDLs described below. By using WDLs it is also easier to incorporate coverage biases that may exist in the satellite regions. Even if de-novo annotations are not available it is possible to pass annotations in the coordinates of a reference (for example T2T-CHM13) to the workflow. Given the reference fasta file (`projectionReferenceFasta`) it can project annotation coordinates from reference to assembly and augment coverage files with the projected annotations. 

A WDL file can be run locally using Cromwell, which is an open-source Workflow Management System for bioinformatics. The latest releases of Cromwell are available [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases) and the documentation is available [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/CommandLine/).

It is recommended to run the whole pipeline using [hmm_flagger_end_to_end_with_mapping.wdl](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/v1.2.0/wdls/workflows/hmm_flagger_end_to_end_with_mapping.wdl).

### The current version of HMM-Flagger-v1.2.0 has different presets for PacBio HiFi, ONT-R9 and ONT-R10.
Use the table below for setting appropriate preset value based on sequencing platform. Different presets have different values for `windowLen` and `alphaTsv`.

| alignerOptions                       | Aligner options. It can be something like '--eqx --cs -Y -L -y' for minimap2/winnowmap. Note that if assembly is diploid and aligner is either minimap2 or winnowmap '-I8g' is necessary. If the reads contain modification tags and these tags are supposed to be present in the final alignment file, alignerOptions should contain '-y' and the aligner should be either minimap2 or winnowmap. If running secphase is enabled it is recommended to add '-p0.5' to alignerOptions; it will keep more secondary alignments so secphase will have more candidates per read. For veritymap '--careful' can be used but not recommended for whole-genome assembly since it increases the runtime dramatically. | String | --eqx -Y -L -y -I8g                                              |

| enableSplittingReadsEqually          | If true it will merge all reads together and then split them into multiple chunks of roughly equal size. Each chunk will then be aligned via a separate task. This feature is useful for running alignment on cloud/slurm systems where there are  multiple nodes available with enough computing power and having alignments tasks distributed among small nodes is more efficient or cheaper than running a single alignment task in a large node. If the  whole workflow is being on a single node it is not recommened to use this feature since merging and splitting reads takes its own time.                                                                                                          | Boolean | false                                                            |

| enableDecomposingCntrBed  | If true it means that cntrBed contains different satellite families like ASat and HSat. This Bed file can be decomposed into multiple bed files; one for each family. This decomposition will benefit bias detection since different types of repeat arrays might have different coverage biases. If this option is true biasAnnotationsBedArray will be filled automatically with the decomposed censat bed files and users can exclude it from their input json. This option shouldn't be true if the names of the satellite families are not mentioned in the tracks of cntrBed.

### Using CHM13 annotation files (Optional)

A set of annotations files in the coordinates of chm13v2.0 are prepared beforehand and they can be used as inputs to the workflow. These bed files are useful when there is no denovo annotation for the assemblies and we like to project annotations from chm13v2.0 to the assembly coordinates for two main purposes:

1. Detecting regions with coverage biases: Satellite repeat arrays might have coverage biases so before running HMM-Flagger it is best to pass those annotations to bam2cov program (with `--runBiasDetection` enabled). bam2cov will inspect those regions and put this information inside the created coverage file if any coverage-biased region was detected.
2. Stratifying final results with the projected annotations.

Using these bed files are optional and the related parameters can be left undefined (being absent from the input json). In this case the workflow should still work properly. However users should be aware that in this case potential coverage biases in HSat arrays may mislead HMM-Flagger.

All files with git and s3 urls are publicly accessible so if you are running the WDL on Terra/AnVIL platforms you can use the same urls. They are also available in the directories `misc/annotations` and `misc/biased_regions` of this repository for those who want to run locally. 

### Other major workflows

[hmm_flagger_end_to_end_with_mapping.wdl](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/v1.2.0/wdls/workflows/hmm_flagger_end_to_end_with_mapping.wdl) is running two major workflows; [long_read_aligner_scattered.wdl](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/v1.1.0/wdls/workflows/long_read_aligner_scattered.wdl) and [hmm_flagger_end_to_end.wdl](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/v1.2.0/wdls/workflows/hmm_flagger_end_to_end.wdl). The first one runs read mapping and the second one runs the end-to-end flagger pipeline (including annotation projection, bias detection, secphase and flagger). 

Users can run each of them separately. For example if there is a read alignment file available beforehand users can run only [hmm_flagger_end_to_end.wdl](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/v1.2.0/wdls/workflows/hmm_flagger_end_to_end.wdl). The parameters for each of these workflows is a subset of the parameters listed above for [hmm_flagger_end_to_end_with_mapping.wdl](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/blob/v1.1.0/wdls/workflows/hmm_flagger_end_to_end_with_mapping.wdl) therefore this table can still be used as a reference for either long_read_aligner_scattered.wdl or hmm_flagger_end_to_end.wdl.


### Running WDLs locally using Cromwell

Below are the main commands for running flagger_end_to_end_with_mapping.wdl locally using Cromwell.
```
wget https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/download/85/cromwell-85.jar
wget https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/download/85/womtool-85.jar

# Get version 1.1.0 of HMM-Flagger
wget https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/archive/refs/tags/v1.2.0.zip

unzip v1.2.0.zip


# make a directory for saving outputs and json files
mkdir workdir 

cd workdir


java -jar ../womtool-85.jar inputs ../flagger-1.0.0/wdls/workflows/hmm_flagger_end_to_end_with_mapping.wdl > inputs.json

```

After modifying `inputs.json`, setting mandatory parameters: `sampleName`, `suffixForFlagger`, `suffixForMapping`, `hap1AssemblyFasta`, `hap2AssemblyFasta`, `readFiles`, `presetForMapping` and removing unspecified parameters (they will be set to default values), users can run the command below:


```
## run flagger workflow
java -jar ../cromwell-85.jar run ../flagger-1.0.0/wdls/workflows/hmm_flagger_end_to_end_with_mapping.wdl -i inputs.json -m outputs.json
```

The paths to output files will be saved in `outputs.json`. The instructions for running any other WDL is similar.

### Running WDLs on Slurm using Toil
Instructions for running WDLs on Slurm are provided [here](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/tree/v1.2.0/test_wdls/toil_on_slurm) , which includes some test data sets for each of the workflows:
- [long_read_aligner_scattered.wdl](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/tree/main/test_wdls/toil_on_slurm#running-long_read_aligner_scatteredwdl-on-test-datasets)
- [hmm_flagger_end_to_end.wdl](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/tree/main/test_wdls/toil_on_slurm#running-hmm_flagger_end_to_endwdl-on-test-datasets)
- [hmm_flagger_end_to_end_with_mapping.wdl](https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger/tree/main/test_wdls/toil_on_slurm#running-hmm_flagger_end_to_end_with_mappingwdl-on-test-datasets)


### Dockstore links

All WDLs are uploaded to Dockstore for easier import into platforms like Terra or AnVIL.

### Components

|Component| Status| Color |Description|
|:--------|:-----|:-----|:----------|
|Err  |**Erroneous** |Red| This block has low read coverage. If it is located in the middle of a contig it could be either a misjoin or a region that needs polishing|
|Dup  |**Duplicated** |Orange| This block is potentially a false duplication of another block. It should mainly include low-MAPQ alignments with half of the expected coverage. Probably one of the copies has to be polished or removed to fix this issue|
|Hap  | **Haploid** |Green| This block is correctly assembled and has the expected read coverage |
|Col |**Collapsed** |Purple| Two or more highly similar haplotypes are collapsed into this block |

Each of these components has their own color when they are shown in the IGV or the UCSC Genome Browser.
